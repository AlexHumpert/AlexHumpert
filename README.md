### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex! During the isolation of the pandemic in early 2020 I set out on a journey to learn data science. Since then I have completed a data analytics bootcamp, taken online courses in statistics and python programming now about to completed a Masters in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE University in Madrid. <br>

In Oct 2022 I joined VML MAP, a marketing center of excellence based in Copenhagen, as a Data Strategy Consultant. Here, I advise Fortune 500 clients on emerging AI technologies and their practical applications within enterprise marketing ecosystems, driving digital transformation initiatives across global markets. __I have had the opportunity to work on many exciting projects, including AI systems, and have yet to update my Github!__ Checkout my [Linked-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-humpert/) page to see what projects I have been involved with professionally. 

The projects below reflect my __interests prior to joining VML MAP__. Looking forward to update my Github with new projects!

I've accumulated some nice projects for your enjoyment - across data visualization, exploratory data analytics, machine learning and even dabbling into some big data technologies. With every project I try to push my learnings to the next level, through tackling more challenging problems or learning more sophisticated data mining techniques. <br>

My goal with this github repo is to showcase the projects I have been working on in an easy to consume way. Feel free to explore. If you see anything that piques your interest or would like to collaborate on a project together, please don't hesitate to reach out!
