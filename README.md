### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex! During the isolation of the pandemic in early 2020 I set out on a journey to learn data science. Since then I have completed Data Analytics Bootcamps, taken online courses in statistics and am now about to complete a Masters in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE University in Madrid. <br>

2 and a half years later and I've accumulated some nice projects for your enjoyment. With every project I try to push my learnings to the next level, whether that be tackling a more challenging problem or learning more sophisticated data mining techniques. <br>

Feel free to explore my portfolio of projects! Feedback is highly welcomed, it's the best way to learn :)
